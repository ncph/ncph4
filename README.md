## History

The first two versions of ncph were curated, single-file video compilations made
by splicing clips together with ffmpeg.

ncph3 was the first iteration which brought the clips to the web, and pioneered
the idea of a web viewer with global synchronization and clip randomization.
The clips from ncph2 were used and several more were added.

ncph4 added the ncph(7) configuration language to allow easier generation and
testing of new clips.
